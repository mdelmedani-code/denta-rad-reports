## ðŸ”’ Security

This application implements comprehensive security measures for handling patient health data:

### Security Features

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: TOTP-based MFA required for all users
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks (5 attempts/15 minutes)
- **CSRF Protection**: Tokens required for all state-changing operations
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS prevention on all user inputs using DOMPurify
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable 7-year audit trail via secure RPC functions
- **File Validation**: Deep inspection of uploaded DICOM files (zip bomb & path traversal detection)
- **Session Management**: Auto-logout after 30 minutes inactivity
- **Password Policy**: Strong passwords enforced (12+ characters, complexity requirements)

### Compliance

- UK GDPR compliant
- NHS Digital security standards aligned
- HIPAA-ready architecture
- SOC 2 Type II infrastructure (Supabase)

### Security Testing

Before deploying to production:

1. Verify all tables have RLS enabled
2. Test authentication rate limiting
3. Test IDOR protection with multiple user accounts
4. Verify CSRF tokens are required
5. Test file upload validation (zip bombs, path traversal)
6. Verify audit logs are immutable
7. Test XSS prevention with malicious inputs

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email security@yourdomain.com

**Do not** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Security Monitoring

Access the security dashboard at `/security-dashboard` (admin only) to monitor:
- Failed login attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
